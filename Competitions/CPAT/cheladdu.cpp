// Chef has N laddus, i-th of which has a size si. 

// There are no two laddues with equal size, i.e. all the laddus have different sizes.

// There are K children that came to meet Chef today.
// Chef wants to give a single laddu to each of these K children.
// Also, he wants to minimize the difference in the sizes which the children get,
// i.e. he wants to minimize the maximum difference in the sizes of the laddus distributed.
// This is because children feel jealous of each other if the other one has a bigger laddu that him/her.

// In other words, find a subset of size K which minimizes the value of
// max_element of the subset - min_element of the subset, and output this minimum difference.
