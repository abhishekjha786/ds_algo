// Thread Pool

// Java Thread poolÂ represents a group of worker threads that are waiting for the job and reuse many times.

// In case of thread pool, a group of fixed size threads are created. A thread from the thread pool
// is pulled out and assigned a job by the service provider. After completion of the job,
// thread is contained in the thread pool again.

// Thread Group

// The thread group creates a tree in which every thread group except the initial thread group has a parent.
