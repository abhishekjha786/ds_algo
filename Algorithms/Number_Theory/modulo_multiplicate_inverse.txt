Recall that

Modulo Arithmetic introduction

(N1 + N2) % mod = (N1 % mod + N2 % mod) % mod      works for subtraction as well

(N1 * N2) % mod = ((N1 % mod) * (N2 % mod)) % mod

But we never aruged the same for division

Here is where we need modulo multiplicate inverse

Is this true ?
(N1 / N2) % mod = ((N1 % mod) / (N2 % mod)) % mod 

(6/2) % 5 = ((6 % 5) / (2 % 5)) % 5
          = ( 1 / 2 ) % 5
          = 0

Should have been 3

WRONG (N1 / N2) % mod = ((N1 % mod) / (N2 % mod)) % mod  WRONG

Multiplicate inverse
10 / 5 = 10  * Multiplicative inverse of 5
       = 10 * (1/5)
       = 10 * 0.2
       = 2

Replace the division operator with the Multiplicative inverse
If we can find the Multiplicative inverse then (Ni)

(N1 / N2) % mod = (N1 * Ni) % mod = ((N1 % mod) * (Ni % mod)) % mod

How to find the multiplicative inverse ?

5 * (1/5) = 1
Modulo multiplicative inverse of number, under modulo P is defined to be a number X such that

N * X is congruent to 1 (% mod)

E.g modulo multiplicative inverse of 5, under 7 is 3 since

5 * 3 = 15 % 7 == 1
Find a number X such that
(n * X) % mod == 1

E.g. 
Modulo multiplicative inverse of 2 under 5 is 3 since (2 * 3) % 5 == 1
(6/2) % 5 = ((6 % 5) * (3 % 5))         (Replace 2 by 3 and division by multiplication)
          = (1 * 3) % 5
          = 3

Do all numbers have modulo multiplicative inverse ?

NO !!!!!!!

E.g. 12 has no modulo multiplicative inverse under 6

coz 12 * X mod 6 is never 1  (in fact 0)

Modulo multiplicative inverse of N under P exists iff GCD(N, P) == 1 
N and P are coprime
