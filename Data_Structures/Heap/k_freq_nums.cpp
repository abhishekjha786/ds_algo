// Given an array of n numbers.
// Your task is to read numbers from the array and keep at-most K numbers at the top
// (According to their decreasing frequency) every time a new number is read.
// We basically need to print top k numbers sorted by frequency when input stream
// has included k distinct elements, else need to print all distinct elements sorted by frequency.

// Example:
// Input :  arr[] = {5, 2, 1, 3, 2}
// k = 4
// Output : 5 2 5 1 2 5 1 2 3 5 2 1 3 5
