// Minimum Spanning Tree
// 
// 
// Tree constructed from graph G, which has minimum weights
// Also it spans the entire Graph G. It has n nodes and n -1 
// edges.

// Given a weighted, undirected and connected graph of V
// vertices and E edges. The task is to find the sum
// of weights of the edges of the Minimum Spanning Tree.
