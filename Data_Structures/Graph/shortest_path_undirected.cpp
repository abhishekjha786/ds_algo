// Shortest Path in Undirected Graph with Unit Weights

// https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/shortest-path-unweighted-graph/


// Given an unweighted graph, a source,
// and a destination, we need to find the shortest path
// from source to destination in the graph in the most optimal way.

// Since the graph is unweighted, we can solve this problem in O(V + E) time.
// The idea is to use a modified version of Breadth-first search
