// Topological Sorting.

// Topological sorting for Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is a
// linear ordering of vertices such that for every directed edge u v, vertex
// u comes before v in the ordering. Topological Sorting
// for a graph is not possible if the graph is not a DAG.

// There can be more than one topological sorting for a graph.

// The first vertex in topological sorting is
// always a vertex with in-degree as 0 (a vertex with no incoming edges).


// https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/topological-sorting/

// Time Complexity: O(V+E). 

// Auxiliary space: O(V). 
// The extra space is needed for the stack.


// Given a Directed Graph with V vertices and E edges, Find any Topological Sorting of that Graph.

// Algorithm: -

// This can be implemented as a modified DFS.
// In topological sorting, we use a temporary stack. We donâ€™t print the vertex immediately, we 
// first recursively call topological sorting for all
// its adjacent vertices, then push it to a stack.
// Finally, print contents of the stack.
// Note that a vertex is pushed to stack only when
// all of its adjacent vertices (and their adjacent vertices and so on) are already in the stack. 
// 
// Traverse DFS such that ending edge is first to go into stack. This ensures ordering.
