Basic terminologies: - 

Parent: - A node which uniquely identifies a set.
E.g. {2, 3, 1}
Parent = 2

E.g. {4, 6}
Parent = 6

Operations in Disjoint Set

Find Operation = Find(m)
Returns which set a particular number belongs to

A = {1, 4, 7}
B = {10, 14}

find(4) = A
find(10) = B

Instead of returning the name of the set.
We can return the parent element

find(4) = 1
find(10) = 14

Union Operation = Union(a, b)

Used to merge 2 sets (one in which a belongs and other in which b belongs)

A = {1, 4, 7}
B = {10, 14}

union(1, 4) will have no effect since both belongs to same set.
union(4, 10) will merge set A and set B.

To perform union.
All we have to do is change the parent pointer of current set to parent pointer of other set.
