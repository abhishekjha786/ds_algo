2 Ways to calculate modulo multiplicative inverse

1. Fermat's little theorm
2. Exteneded Euclidean Algorithm

Running time of both of them is same.

Fermat's little theorm: -

For a prime number m and an integer a coprime with m.

a ^ (m - 1) is congruent to 1 under modulo m

a ^ (m - 1) == 1 under modulo m

Divide both sides by a we get.

a ^ (m - 2) == a ^ (-1) under modulo m.

So this means that to calculate a inverse we need to calculate a ^ (m - 2) modulo m.

This is how we can calculate modulo multiplicative inverse.

To calculate modulo multiplicative inverse of 'a' we need to calculate a ^ (m - 2) modulo m.

C ++ code to calculate modulo multiplicative inverse of a.

int main()
{
    
}
